Technologies configurations used in EXEHDA-ISSA prototype

The intent of this repository is to share the configuration files used in the EXEHDA-ISSA prototipation. With the objective to ease the replication of the scenarios presented in the article under review.

We do not claim ownership on these configurations. As some of them were found on Google as is and some were fixed to address issues present due to incorrect syntax.
These configuration files are currently in production in our environment and are operating normally with Logstash 5.3.

For more information or additional configuration files (Kibana Dashboards, Logstash configs or screens) can be released upon request. 

If you have any doubts or suggestions, please e-mail us at: exehda.issa@gmail.com.
