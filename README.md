Technologies configurations used in EXEHDA-ISSA prototype

The intent of this repository is to share the configuration files used in the EXEHDA-ISSA scenario aming to provide facilities to the replication of this scenario.

I do not claim ownership on all these configurations.
Some of them were found on Google as is and some were fixed by me to address issudes like in normalization and contextualization.
These are currently in production in my environment and are operating normally with Logstash 5.3.

More information (kibana dashboards configurations or screens, ...) upon request. Doubts and suggestions: exehda.issa@gmail.com.
