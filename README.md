# EXEHDA-ISSA technologies

This repository intends to share the configuration files used in the prototyping and evaluation scenario of the article "An architectural model for network security exploring situation awareness". The purpose of doing this is to demonstrate some of the technologies used in use cases and provide facilities to its replication.

We do not claim ownership on these configurations as some of them were found on Google as is and some were fixed to address issues present due to incorrect syntax. These configuration files are currently in production in our environment and are operating normally with Logstash 5.3.

For more information or additional configuration files (Kibana Dashboards, Logstash configs or screens) can be released upon request.

If you have any doubts or suggestions, please e-mail us at exehda.issa@gmail.com.
